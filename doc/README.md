#Documentation

You can split the documentation for every development tool in three stages of increasing complexity.

In stage I the good developer fairy has magically created the perfect environment and all you have to do is use it.

In stage II the fairy went on holiday and now you actually have to setup and configure everything before you can actually do some work.

And in stage III you have to build the thing from scratch because the evil manager witch forces you to use it. Smile, at least it's open source <em>evil grin</em>

## Stage I : Use

  * [Object hierarchy](HIERARCHY.md) 

## Stage II: Setup & Configure

  * Notes on [configuring Gaudi](CONFIGURATION.md)
  * [Conventions](CONVENTIONS.md)

## Stage III: No guts, no glory
 
 * [Extending](EXTENDING.md) Gaudi
 * [Examples](examples/) 

## Stage IV: Beyond the pain

 * [Reasonings](REASONINGS.md) behind the design choices in Gaudi
