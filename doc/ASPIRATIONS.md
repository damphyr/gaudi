# A List of Whishes

"In theory, there is no difference between theory and praxis. In praxis, there is"

Consider the following aphorisms as the theory.

## Just the Repository

 * I will be able to recreate my software with just the repository
 * I will be able to recreate my software development environment with just the repository
 * I will be able to run my software with just the repository
 * I will be able to test my software with just the repository

## One Source of Truth

 * When something changes, it only changes in one place
 * When I need to find something out, I look in one place

## We Are All Experts

 * I can do all the things without knowing all the details

## Out of Band Builds

 * Artifacts created by the build system are separate from the sources we use to create them
 * No build artifact is commited to the repository. Ever.

 ## Breadcrumbs everywhere

 * At any point in time I am able to exactly reproduce the commands up to that point
 * I have a record or every command executed by the system
