#0.12.0
 * Auto-generated build rules per target platform (makes running off-the-shelf a little bit easier)
* Modules concept allows us to place code in directories other than custom

#0.11.0
 * Allow multiple source subdirectories per platform configuration
 * Allow compiler options specific to the file extension

#0.10.3
 * Bugfix Gaudi::Component#interface now handles multiple header extensions correctly
#0.10.2
 * Actually allow a Component to instantiate with no build.cfg
#0.10.1
 * Minor fix to allow absolute paths with quotes (damn you Windows!)
#0.10.0
 * Allow for missing build.cfg files
 * Returned paths are now absolute

#0.9.2
 * Log reduction
#0.9.1
 * Fixed broken Gaudi.configuration
#0.9.0
 * Allow interpolation of values in configuration files with %{value}

#0.8.1
 * Gaudi::Program now looks for sources in a like-named code component
#0.8.0
 * Breadcrumb files for compilation no longer created next to the sources (created next to the output)
 * Breadcrumb extension is now .breadcrumb in the generic case (.link and .library are still used)

#0.7.9
 * Expose the name of the deployment in a Gaudi::Program instance
 * Bugfix in graph:deployment
#0.7.8
 * Allow quotes in paths within configuration parameters
#0.7.7
 * Component dependencies now include all headers not just the public ones
#0.7.6
 * .s are assembly files
 * fixed option setting for assembler to accomodate IAR
#0.7.5
 * Added list:deployments task
#0.7.4
 * Fixed a bug with the assembler breadcrumb extension
 * Fixed a bug where source and header extensions were not recognised if there were spaces in the configuration
#0.7.3
 * Fixed a bug in naming object files using a parent component
#0.7.2
 * Removed scaffolding code (new:project task)
#0.7.1
 * Gaudi:Component now has a reference to parent Program or Library if it exists
#0.7.0
 * Platform configuration is now progressively extended by program and component configurations. Solves bugs #1 & #3

#0.6.0
 * Removed command files from the dependency chain.
 ** This removes some buggy edge cases and has minimal performance impact. Also makes creating build rules simpler
 * switch_configuration and switch_platform_configuration are now in Gaudi::Configuration

#0.5.0
 * Moved artifact naming methods over to custom/paths.rb
 * The configuration classes now enumerate all configuration files and respond to configuration_files() returning an Array
 * removed config_file from the configuration classes. Use configuration_files.first to get the main file
 * Deployments don't allow programs of the same name in the same platform
#0.4.0
 * Binary extensions now part of the platform configuration
 * Platform configuration now shared library aware. Archiver renamed to Librarian

# 0.3.0
 * Source file extensions now part of the platform configuration
 * The directory structure methods are now in custom/helpers/paths.rb

# 0.2.0
 * Test coverage is satisfactory
 * Path and dependency resolution work reliably
 * Configuration system is stable
 * Scaffolding code added

# 0.0.1
 * Initial version, totally unstable
